# C# => Executable
Simple bash script for converting a C# file to an executable.

## Usage
This command will give the script executable permissions
```bash
chmod +x cstoexe.sh
```

```bash
./cstoexe.sh
```

NOTE: Due to the evolution of .NET, this script may not work (perfectly) for .NET 6.0+. It all depends on which features are used during development.
